# SandboxConverter
A utility for converting Halo 3 Forge maps to Halo Online.

## Usage
To use the tool, you must have a valid Halo 3 Usermap (called Sandbox.map) that DOES NOT reside an XBox 360 container. Once you have that, simply run "SandboxConverter.exe sandbox.map output.map" and the program will spit out a usermap that is compatible with Halo Online. Then, just install the usermap as you normally would in Halo Online.

There are plenty of good tools for extracting Halo 3 usermaps out of XBox 360 containers. Just use Google! Maybe in the future this tool will be container agnostic, and will work without the user extracting the usermap from a container.
